*NOTE: It may be a bit too early for yet another update since v0.2.0 was just released on 10/17. But there was a feature I **really** wanted to release, and figured that it'd be ideal to do so on Hachi's 1st birthday!*

Below is a description of updates made to Hachi version 0.2.1

# Version 0.2.1 - October 23rd, 2024

## Use `hachi` as a C/C++ build tool.

Hachi now has a new flag "-cc", which allows you to use hachi as a C/C++ build tool.

`hachi file.cpp -cc "-ldl -o program"`

# Mike's Thoughts
Like I said in last release, I thought this feature in Zig was cool, and I wanted it for my own convenience. 

The idea of Hachi ultimately culminated from a desire to have wield seamless and simple C++ interoperability, and Hachi is the answer for having this at the language level. As my own professional work with the language requires more integration with C-family components, I'm planning near-future features to mostly revolve around said interop.

Also, Hachiko, the doggo who's this project's namesake, has his 9th birthday on October 31st, so early-Happy Birthday to Hachiko and Hachi!!
